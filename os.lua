--- The os library is a standard Lua library originally intended to allow Lua access to various features of the Operating System it's running on, however many of the features and functions have been removed in Garry's Mod due to security issues. It's only used in Garry's Mod for date & time operations.
os = {}

---Returns the approximate cpu time the application ran.
--- See also [Global.SysTime](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.SysTime)
--- **NOTE**: This function has different precision on Linux (1/100).

---
--- Returns a string or a table containing date and time, formatted according
--- to the given string `format`.
---
--- If the `time` argument is present, this is the time to be formatted (see
--- the `os.time` function for a description of this value). Otherwise,
--- `date` formats the current time.
---
--- If `format` starts with '`!`', then the date is formatted in Coordinated
--- Universal Time. After this optional character, if `format` is the string
--- "`*t`", then `date` returns a table with the following fields:
---
--- **`year`** (four digits)
--- **`month`** (1–12)
--- **`day`** (1-31)
--- **`hour`** (0-23)
--- **`min`** (0-59)
--- **`sec`** (0-61), due to leap seconds
--- **`wday`** (weekday, 1–7, Sunday is 1)
--- **`yday`** (day of the year, 1–366)
--- **`isdst`** (daylight saving flag, a boolean). This last field may be absent
--- if the information is not available.
---
--- If `format` is not "`*t`", then `date` returns the date as a string,
--- formatted according to the same rules as the ISO C function `strftime`.
---
--- When called without arguments, `date` returns a reasonable date and time
--- representation that depends on the host system and on the current locale.
--- (More specifically, `os.date()` is equivalent to `os.date("%c")`.)
---
--- On non-POSIX systems, this function may be not thread safe because of its
--- reliance on C function `gmtime` and C function `localtime`.

---@param format string # The format string. If `*t` or `!*t`, returns a [Structures/DateData](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Structures/DateData) table instead.
---@param time? number # Time to use for the format.
---@return string|DateData # Formatted date string, or a DateData table if format is `*t` or `!*t`.
function os.date(format, time) end

---Subtracts the second from the first value and rounds the result.

---Returns the system time in seconds past the unix epoch. If a table is supplied, the function attempts to build a system time with the specified table members.
