---@meta

--- For a list of possible members of [Scripted Entities](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Scripted_Entities) see [ENT Structure](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Structures/ENT).
---@class Entity
---@field BaseClass table? The base class table of this entity, used for inheritance in the scripted entity system.
---@field EntityMods table? A table of entity modifications stored by the duplicator system via Entity:SetEntityMods.
local Entity = {}
---@class ENTITY : Entity
ENTITY = Entity

---Returns a table containing all key-value pairs stored on this entity's Lua table.
---The returned table contains all fields but method calls via `:` are not supported.
---@return tableof<self>
function Entity:GetTable() end

---Called when another entity fires an event to this entity.
---@hook AcceptInput
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:AcceptInput
---@param inputName string The name of the input that was triggered.
---@param activator Entity The initial cause for the input getting triggered. (e.g. the player who pushed a button)
---@param caller Entity The entity that directly triggered the input. (e.g. the button that was pushed)
---@param param string The input parameter.
---@return boolean # Should we suppress the default action for this input?
---
--- Returning `true` for unknown inputs will also prevent the game complaining about the unknown input in console with `developer 2`.
function Entity:AcceptInput(inputName, activator, caller, param) end

---Activates the entity. This needs to be used on some entities (like constraints) after being spawned.
---
--- **NOTE**: For some entity types when this function is used after [Entity:SetModelScale](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetModelScale), the physics object will be recreated with the new scale. [Source-sdk-2013](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/55ed12f8d1eb6887d348be03aee5573d44177ffb/mp/src/game/server/baseanimating.cpp#L321-L327).
---
--- Calling this method after [Entity:SetModelScale](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetModelScale) will recreate a new scaled `SOLID_VPHYSICS` [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj) on scripted entities. This can be a problem if you made a properly scaled [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj) of another kind (using [Entity:PhysicsInitSphere](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:PhysicsInitSphere) for instance) or if you edited the [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj)'s properties. This is especially the behavior of the Sandbox spawn menu.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:Activate
function Entity:Activate() end

---Add a callback function to a specific event. This is used instead of hooks to avoid calling empty functions unnecessarily.
---
--- This also allows you to use certain hooks in engine entities (non-scripted entities).
---
--- **WARNING**: This method does not check if the function has already been added to this object before, so if you add the same callback twice, it will be run twice! Make sure to add your callback only once.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:AddCallback
---@param hook string The hook name to hook onto. See Entity Callbacks
---@param func function The function to call. It's arguments and return values will depend on the hook specified in the first argument.
---@return number # The callback ID that was just added, which can later be used in Entity:RemoveCallback.
---
--- Returns nothing if the passed callback function was invalid or when asking for a non-existent hook.
function Entity:AddCallback(hook, func) end

---Applies an engine effect to an entity.

---A helper function for creating [Scripted Entities](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Scripted_Entities).
---
--- Similar to [ENTITY:AddOutputFromKeyValue](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:AddOutputFromKeyValue), call it from [ENTITY:AcceptInput](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:AcceptInput) and it'll return true if it successfully added an output from the passed input data.
---@hook AddOutputFromAcceptInput
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:AddOutputFromAcceptInput
---@param name string The input name from ENTITY:AcceptInput.
---@param data string The input data from ENTITY:AcceptInput.
---@return boolean # Whether any outputs were added or not.
function Entity:AddOutputFromAcceptInput(name, data) end

---A helper function for creating [Scripted Entities](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Scripted_Entities).
---
--- Call it from [ENTITY:KeyValue](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:KeyValue) and it'll return true if it successfully added an output from the passed KV pair.
---@hook AddOutputFromKeyValue
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:AddOutputFromKeyValue
---@param key string The key-value key.

---@param flags number The flag(s) to apply, see Enums/FSOLID.
function Entity:AddSolidFlags(flags) end

---Adds onto the current SpawnFlags of an Entity.
---
--- SpawnFlags can easily be found on https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/.
---
--- 	**NOTE**: See also [Entity:RemoveSpawnFlags](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:RemoveSpawnFlags), [Entity:SetSpawnFlags](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetSpawnFlags)
---
--- 	Using [SF Enumerations](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Enums/SF) won't work, if this function is ran clientside due to the enumerations being defined only Serverside. Use the actual SpawnFlag number.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:AddSpawnFlags
---@param flag number The SpawnFlag to add to the Entity
function Entity:AddSpawnFlags(flag) end

---Adds a [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj)ect to the entity's motion controller so that [ENTITY:PhysicsSimulate](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:PhysicsSimulate) will be called for given [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj)ect as well.
---
--- You must first create a motion controller with [Entity:StartMotionController](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:StartMotionController).
---
--- You can remove added [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj)ects by using [Entity:RemoveFromMotionController](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:RemoveFromMotionController).
---
--- **NOTE**: Only works on a scripted [Entity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity) of anim type
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:AddToMotionController
---@param physObj PhysObj The PhysObj to add to the motion controller.
function Entity:AddToMotionController(physObj) end

---Returns an angle based on the ones inputted that you can use to align an object.
---
--- **NOTE**: This function doesn't change the angle of the entity on its own (see example).
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:AlignAngles
---@param from Angle The angle you want to align from
---@param to Angle The angle you want to align to
---@return Angle # The resulting aligned angle
function Entity:AlignAngles(from, to) end

---Checks if the entity is considered alive.
---
--- Checks entity's internal life state variable. Does not check health, but it is generally expected the health to be 0 or below at the point of an entity being considered dead. This internally looks up the save value `m_lifeState`
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:Alive
---@return boolean # Whether the entity is considered alive.
function Entity:Alive() end

---Spawns a clientside ragdoll for the entity, positioning it in place of the original entity, and makes the entity invisible. It doesn't preserve flex values (face posing) as CSRagdolls don't support flex.
---
--- It does not work on players. Use [Player:CreateRagdoll](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player:CreateRagdoll) instead.
---
--- The original entity is not removed, and neither are any ragdolls previously generated with this function.
---
--- To make the entity re-appear, run [Entity:SetNoDraw](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetNoDraw)( false )
---@realm client
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:BecomeRagdollOnClient
---@return Entity # The created ragdoll. (`class C_ClientRagdoll`)
function Entity:BecomeRagdollOnClient() end

---Returns true if the entity is being looked at by the local player and is within 256 units of distance.
---
--- **NOTE**: This function is only available in entities that are based off of sandbox's base_gmodentity.
---@realm client
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:BeingLookedAtByLocalPlayer
---@return boolean # Is the entity being looked at by the local player and within 256 units.
function Entity:BeingLookedAtByLocalPlayer() end

---**INTERNAL**: This is used internally - although you're able to use it you probably shouldn't.
---  Dispatches blocked events to this entity's blocked handler. This function is only useful when interacting with entities like func_movelinear.
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:Blocked
---@param entity Entity The entity that is blocking us
function Entity:Blocked(entity) end

---Returns a centered vector of this entity, NPCs use this internally to aim at their targets.
---
--- **NOTE**: This only works on players and NPCs.
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:BodyTarget
---@param origin Vector The vector of where the the attack comes from.
---@param noisy? boolean Decides if it should return the centered vector with a random offset to it.
---@return Vector # The centered vector.
function Entity:BodyTarget(origin, noisy) end

---Returns whether the entity's bone has the flag or not.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:BoneHasFlag
---@param boneID number Bone ID to test flag of.
---@param flag BONE The flag to test, see Enums/BONE
---@return boolean # Whether the bone has that flag or not
function Entity:BoneHasFlag(boneID, flag) end

---Returns the length between given bone's position and the position of given bone's parent.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:BoneLength
---@param boneID number The ID of the bone you want the length of. You may want to get the length of the next bone ( boneID + 1 ) for decent results
---@return number # The length of the bone
function Entity:BoneLength(boneID) end

---Returns the distance between the center of the bounding box and the furthest bounding box corner.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:BoundingRadius
---@return number # The radius of the bounding box.
function Entity:BoundingRadius() end

---Called whenever the entity's position changes. A callback for when an entity's angle changes is available via [Entity:AddCallback](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:AddCallback).
---
--- Like [ENTITY:RenderOverride](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:RenderOverride), this hook works on any entity (scripted or not) it is applied on.
---
--- **NOTE**: If EFL_DIRTY_ABSTRANSFORM is set on the entity, this will be called serverside only; otherwise, this will be called clientside only. This means serverside calls of [Entity:SetPos](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetPos) without the EFL_DIRTY_ABSTRANSFORM flag enabled (most cases) will be called clientside only.
---
--- **NOTE**: The give concommand will call this hook serverside only upon entity spawn.
---@hook CalcAbsolutePosition
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:CalcAbsolutePosition
---@param pos Vector The entity's actual position. May differ from Entity:GetPos
---@param ang Angle The entity's actual angles. May differ from Entity:GetAngles
---@return Vector # New position
---@return Angle # New angles
function Entity:CalcAbsolutePosition(pos, ang) end

---Calls all [Entity:NetworkVarNotify](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVarNotify) functions with the given new value, but doesn't change the real value.

---
--- * `String` (up to 511 characters)
--- * `Bool`
--- * `Float`
--- * `Int` (32-bit signed integer)
--- * `Vector`
--- * `Angle`
--- * `Entity`
---@param slot number The NetworkVar slot. See Entity:NetworkVar for more detailed explanation.
---@param newValue any The new value.
function Entity:CallDTVarProxies(type, slot, newValue) end

---Causes a specified function to be run if the entity is removed by any means. This can later be undone by [Entity:RemoveCallOnRemove](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:RemoveCallOnRemove) if you need it to not run.
---
--- **WARNING**: This hook is called clientside during full updates. See [GM:EntityRemoved](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:EntityRemoved) for more information.
---
--- **WARNING**: An error being thrown inside `removeFunc` will stop other `EntityRemoved` hooks from executing.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CallOnRemove
---@param identifier any Identifier that can be optionally used with Entity:RemoveCallOnRemove to undo this call on remove.
---@param removeFunc fun(ent: Entity, ...: any) Function to be called on remove.
---
--- Function argument(s):
--- * Entity `ent` - The entity about to be removed.
--- * vararg `data` - Data passed from the arguments to `CallOnRemove`.
---@param ... any Optional arguments to pass to removeFunc. Do note that the first argument passed to the function will always be the entity being removed, and the arguments passed on here start after that.
function Entity:CallOnRemove(identifier, removeFunc, ...) end

---Called by the Sandbox gamemode from the default implementation of [GM:CanEditVariable](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:CanEditVariable).
---@hook CanEditVariables
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:CanEditVariables
---@param ply Player The player is trying to edit a variable on this entity.
---@return boolean # `true` to allow the edit, `false` to disallow.
function Entity:CanEditVariables(ply) end

---Controls if a property can be used on this entity or not.
---
--- This hook will only work in Sandbox derived gamemodes that do not have [GM:CanProperty](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:CanProperty) overridden.
---
--- **NOTE**: This hook will work on ALL entities, not just the scripted ones (SENTs)
---@hook CanProperty
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:CanProperty
---@param ply Player Player, that tried to use the property
---@param property string Class of the property that is tried to use, for example - bonemanipulate
---@return boolean # Return false to disallow using that property, return true to allow.
---
--- You must return a value. Not returning anything can cause unexpected results.
function Entity:CanProperty(ply, property) end

---Controls if a tool can be used on this entity or not.
---
--- This hook will only work in Sandbox derived gamemodes that do not have [SANDBOX:CanTool](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/SANDBOX:CanTool) overridden.
---
--- **NOTE**: This hook will work on ALL entities, not just the scripted ones (SENTs)
---@hook CanTool
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:CanTool
---@param ply Player Player, that tried to use the tool
---@param tr TraceResult The trace of the tool.
--- Returns only [Entity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Structures/TraceResult#Entity) when the 5th argument returns `4`
---@param toolname string Class of the tool that is tried to use, for example - `weld`
---@param tool table The tool mode table the player currently has selected.
---@param button number The tool button pressed.
--- * 1 - left click
--- * 2 - right click
--- * 3 - reload
--- * 4 - Menu (No interaction with the toolgun)
--- The number `4` is a test that Rubat is conducting to implement the CanTool in the SpawnMenu. It may disappear.
---@return boolean # Return `false` to disallow using that tool on this entity, return `true` to allow.
function Entity:CanTool(ply, tr, toolname, tool, button) end

---Clears all registered events for map I/O outputs on this entity. If a string is given, will use the string as a wildcard to limit removed outputs by name matches.
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:ClearAllOutputs
---@param outputName? string An optional string that will be used to limit removed outputs by name matches, supports wildcards.
function Entity:ClearAllOutputs(outputName) end

---Resets all pose parameters such as aim_yaw, aim_pitch and rotation.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:ClearPoseParameters
function Entity:ClearPoseParameters() end

---Declares that the collision rules of the entity have changed, and subsequent calls for [GM:ShouldCollide](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:ShouldCollide) with this entity may return a different value than they did previously.
---
--- **WARNING**: This function must **not** be called inside of [GM:ShouldCollide](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:ShouldCollide). Instead, it must be called in advance when the condition is known to change.
---
--- **WARNING**: Failure to use this function correctly will result in a crash of the physics engine.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CollisionRulesChanged
function Entity:CollisionRulesChanged() end

---Same as [Entity:GetBoneMatrix](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetBoneMatrix), but instead of returning a new matrix object, it copies the data to a given matrix.
---
--- This is measurably faster when accessing bone matrices a lot.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CopyBoneMatrix
---@param boneID number The bone ID to retrieve matrix of, starting at index 0.
---@param data VMatrix The matrix to copy the bone matrix to.
function Entity:CopyBoneMatrix(boneID, data) end

---Creates bone followers based on the current entity model.
---
--- Bone followers are [Entities](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity) whose [Physics Object](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj) follows a specific bone on another Entity's model.
--- This is what is used by `prop_dynamic` for things like big combine doors for vehicles with multiple physics objects which follow the visual mesh of the door when it animates.
---
--- Be mindful that bone followers create a separate entity (`phys_bone_follower`) for each physics object.
---
--- You must call [Entity:UpdateBoneFollowers](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:UpdateBoneFollowers) every tick for bone followers to update their positions.
---
--- **NOTE**: This function only works on `anim`, `nextbot` and `ai` type entities.
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CreateBoneFollowers
---@param bone_whitelist? table If set, a whitelist of bone names to create bone followers for. If a models' bone name is not in this list, a bone follower entity will not be created for it.

---Returns whether the entity was created by map or not.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CreatedByMap
---@return boolean # Is created by map?
function Entity:CreatedByMap() end

---Creates a clientside particle system attached to the entity. See also [Global.CreateParticleSystem](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.CreateParticleSystem)
---
--- **NOTE**: The particle effect must be precached with [Global.PrecacheParticleSystem](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.PrecacheParticleSystem) and the file its from must be added via [game.AddParticles](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/game.AddParticles) before it can be used!
---@realm client
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CreateParticleEffect
---@param particle string The particle name to create
---@param attachment number Attachment ID to attach the particle to
---@param options? table A table of tables ( IDs 1 to 64 ) having the following structure:
--- * number attachtype - The particle attach type. See Enums/PATTACH. **Default:** PATTACH_ABSORIGIN
--- * Entity entity - The parent entity? **Default:** NULL
--- * Vector position - The offset position for given control point. **Default:**  nil
---
--- This only affects the control points of the particle effects and will do nothing if the effect doesn't use control points.
---@return CNewParticleEffect # The created particle system.
function Entity:CreateParticleEffect(particle, attachment, options) end

---**INTERNAL**: This is used internally - although you're able to use it you probably shouldn't.
--- Called just before [ENTITY:Initialize](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:Initialize) for "ai" type entities only.
---@hook CreateSchedulesInternal

function Entity:DeleteOnRemove(entityToRemove) end

---Destroys bone followers created by [Entity:CreateBoneFollowers](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CreateBoneFollowers).
---
--- **NOTE**: This function only works on `anim` type entities.
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:DestroyBoneFollowers
function Entity:DestroyBoneFollowers() end

---Removes the shadow for the entity.
---
--- The shadow will be recreated as soon as the entity wakes.
---
--- **NOTE**: Doesn't affect shadows from flashlight/lamps/env_projectedtexture.
---@realm client
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:DestroyShadow

---Performs a trace attack towards the entity this function is called on, as if an invisible bullet is shot towards it. Visually identical to [Entity:TakeDamageInfo](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:TakeDamageInfo).
--- **WARNING**: Calling this function on the victim entity in [ENTITY:OnTakeDamage](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:OnTakeDamage) can cause infinite loops.
---
--- **NOTE**: This function correctly applies damage to [func_breakable_surf](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Func_breakable_surf) entities, unlike [Entity:TakeDamageInfo](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:TakeDamageInfo).
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:DispatchTraceAttack
---@param damageInfo CTakeDamageInfo The damage to apply.
---@param traceRes table Trace result to use to deal damage. See Structures/TraceResult
---@param dir? Vector Direction of the attack.
function Entity:DispatchTraceAttack(damageInfo, traceRes, dir) end

---Dissolves the entity.
---
--- This function creates an `env_entity_dissolver` entity internally, which seems to be deleted in the same frame. Calling this function on an entity that is already dissolving will not create another `env_entity_dissolver` entity.
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:Dissolve
---@param type? number Dissolve type. Should be one of the following values:
---
--- | ID | Description |

--- | 3 | ENTITY_DISSOLVE_CORE |
---@param magnitude? number Magnitude of the dissolve effect, its effect depends on the dissolve type.
---@param origin? Vector The origin for the dissolve effect, its effect depends on the dissolve type. Defaults to entity's origin.
function Entity:Dissolve(type, magnitude, origin) end

---Called so the entity can override the bullet impact effects it makes. This is called when the entity itself fires bullets via [Entity:FireBullets](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:FireBullets), not when it gets hit.
---
--- **NOTE**: This hook only works for the `anim` type entities.
---@hook DoImpactEffect

---@return boolean # Return true to not do the default thing - which is to call `UTIL_ImpactTrace` in C++
function Entity:DoImpactEffect(tr, damageType) end

---Called by the default `base_ai` SNPC, checking whether `ENT.bDoingEngineSchedule` is set by [ENTITY:StartEngineSchedule](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:StartEngineSchedule)..
--- **NOTE**: This is a helper function only available if your SENT is based on `base_ai`

function Entity:DoSchedule(sched) end

---Called if and when the entity should be drawn opaquely, based on the [Entity:GetRenderGroup](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetRenderGroup) of the entity.
---
--- See [Structures/ENT](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Structures/ENT) and [Enums/RENDERGROUP](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Enums/RENDERGROUP) for more information.
---
--- See also [ENTITY:DrawTranslucent](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:DrawTranslucent).
---
--- **NOTE**: This function will not called if the entity's render bounds are not in player's view. See [Entity:SetRenderBounds](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetRenderBounds).
---@hook Draw
---@realm client
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:Draw
---@param flags number The bit flags from Enums/STUDIO
function Entity:Draw(flags) end

---Draws the entity or model.
---
--- If called inside [ENTITY:Draw](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:Draw) or [ENTITY:DrawTranslucent](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:DrawTranslucent), it only draws the entity's model itself.
---
--- If called outside of those hooks, it will call both of said hooks depending on [Entity:GetRenderGroup](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetRenderGroup), drawing the entire entity again.
---
--- When drawing an entity more than once per frame in different positions, you should call [Entity:SetupBones](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetupBones) before each draw; Otherwise, the entity will retain its first drawn position.
---
--- Calling this on entities with [EF_BONEMERGE](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Enums/EF) and [EF_NODRAW](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Enums/EF) applied causes a crash.
---
--- Using this with a map model ([game.GetWorld](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/game.GetWorld)():[GetModel](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetModel)()) crashes the game.
---
--- Calling this on a player during that player's [GM:PrePlayerDraw](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:PrePlayerDraw) hook call will cause infinite recursion and crash the game.
---@realm client
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:DrawModel
---@param flags? number The optional Enums/STUDIO flags, usually taken from ENTITY:Draw and similar hooks.

---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:DrawShadow
---@param shouldDraw boolean True to enable, false to disable shadow drawing.
function Entity:DrawShadow(shouldDraw) end

---Called when the entity should be drawn translucently. If your scripted entity has a translucent model, it will be invisible unless it is drawn here.

---**INTERNAL**: You should use [Entity:NetworkVar](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVar) instead
---
--- Sets up a self.dt.NAME alias for a Data Table variable.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:DTVar
---@overload fun(type: string, name: string)
---@param type string The type of the DTVar being set up. Supported choices:

--- * `Bool`
--- * `Float`
--- * `Int` (32-bit signed integer)
--- * `Vector`
--- * `Angle`
--- * `Entity`
---@param slot number The ID of the DTVar. Can be between `0` and `3` for strings, `0` and `31` for everything else.
---
--- This can be omitted entirely (arguments will shift) and it will use the next available slot.
---@param name string Name by which you will refer to DTVar. It must be a valid variable name. (No spaces!)
function Entity:DTVar(type, slot, name) end

---Plays a sound on an entity. See also [Global.EmitSound](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.EmitSound) if you wish to play sounds without an entity.
---
--- If run clientside, the sound will only be heard locally.
--- If used on a player or NPC character with the mouth rigged, the character will "lip-sync" if the sound file contains lipsync data. See [this page](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Choreography_creation/Lip_syncing) for more information.
---
--- **NOTE**: When using this function with weapons, use the [Weapon](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Weapon) itself as the entity, not its owner!
---
--- **WARNING**: Due to engine quirks, [sound scripts](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Soundscripts) can't have their soundlevel, pitch, volume, or channel changed when played from an entity—the sound script parameters will override whatever you pass to this function.
---
--- You can do one of these instead:
--- * Use [sound.GetProperties](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/sound.GetProperties) to select a sound from the script, and play the sound file directly.
--- * For single-use sounds, you can pass the [SND_CHANGE_VOL](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Enums/SND) or [SND_CHANGE_PITCH](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Enums/SND) sound flags. However, this will change the volume or pitch of the sound if it's already playing, instead of starting the sound over or playing another instance.
--- * Use [Global.EmitSound](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.EmitSound) with the entity parameter set to the [Entity:EntIndex](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:EntIndex) of the entity you want to play the sound on.
---
--- This does not respond to [Global.SuppressHostEvents](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.SuppressHostEvents).
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:EmitSound
---@param soundName string The name of the sound to be played.
---
--- This should either be a sound script name (sound.Add) or a file path relative to the `sound/` folder. (so don't include `sound/`, and make note that it's not sound**s** when moving the sound file itself)
---
--- The string cannot have whitespace at the start or end. You can remove this with [string.Trim](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/string.Trim).
---@param soundLevel? number A modifier for the distance this sound will reach, acceptable range is 0 to 511. 100 means no adjustment to the level. See Enums/SNDLVL
---@param pitchPercent? number The pitch applied to the sound. The acceptable range is from 0 to 255. 100 means the pitch is not changed.
---@param volume? number The volume, from 0 to 1.
---@param channel? number The sound channel, see Enums/CHAN.
---@param soundFlags? number The flags of the sound, see Enums/SND
---@param dsp? number The DSP preset for this sound. DSP_Presets
---@param filter? CRecipientFilter If set serverside, the sound will only be networked to the clients in the filter.
function Entity:EmitSound(soundName, soundLevel, pitchPercent, volume, channel, soundFlags, dsp, filter) end

---Toggles the constraints of this ragdoll entity on and off.
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:EnableConstraints
---@param toggleConstraints boolean Set to true to enable the constraints and false to disable them.
---
--- Disabling constraints will delete the constraints.
function Entity:EnableConstraints(toggleConstraints) end

---Flags an entity as using custom lua defined collisions. Fixes entities having spongy player collisions or not hitting traces, such as after [Entity:PhysicsFromMesh](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:PhysicsFromMesh)
---
--- Internally identical to `Entity:AddSolidFlags( bit.bor( FSOLID_CUSTOMRAYTEST, FSOLID_CUSTOMBOXTEST ) )`
---
--- Do not confuse this function with [Entity:SetCustomCollisionCheck](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetCustomCollisionCheck), they are not the same.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:EnableCustomCollisions
function Entity:EnableCustomCollisions() end

---Can be used to apply a custom [VMatrix](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/VMatrix) to the entity, mostly used for scaling the model by a [Vector](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Vector).
---
--- To disable it, use [Entity:DisableMatrix](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:DisableMatrix).
---
--- If your old scales are wrong due to a recent update, use [Entity:SetLegacyTransform](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetLegacyTransform) as a quick fix.
---
--- **NOTE**: The matrix can also be modified to apply a custom rotation and offset via the [VMatrix:SetAngles](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/VMatrix:SetAngles) and [VMatrix:SetTranslation](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/VMatrix:SetTranslation) functions.
---
--- This does not scale procedural bones, and disables inverse kinematics of the entity.
---@realm client
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:EnableMatrix
---@param matrixType string The name of the matrix type.
--- Currently the only matrix type is `"RenderMultiply"`.

---
--- See [ENTITY:StartTouch](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:StartTouch) and [ENTITY:Touch](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:Touch) for related hooks.
---
--- **WARNING**: This only works for **brush** entities and for entities that have [Entity:SetTrigger](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetTrigger) set to true.
---@hook EndTouch
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:EndTouch
---@param entity Entity The entity that we no longer touch.

function Entity:Extinguish() end

---Returns the direction a player, npc or ragdoll is looking as a world-oriented angle.
---
--- This can return an incorrect value in vehicles (like pods, buggy, ...). **This bug has been fixed in the past but was causing many addons being broken, so the fix has been removed but applied to [Player:GetAimVector](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player:GetAimVector) only**.
---
--- This may return local angles in jeeps when used with [Player:EnterVehicle](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player:EnterVehicle). **A workaround is available in the second example.**

---Fires an entity's input, conforming to the map IO event queue system. You can find inputs for most entities on the [Valve Developer Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Output)
---
--- See also [Entity:Input](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:Input) for a function that bypasses the event queue and [GM:AcceptInput](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:AcceptInput).
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:Fire

---@param delay? number Delay in seconds before firing
---@param activator? Entity The entity that caused this input (i.e. the player who pushed a button)
---@param caller? Entity The entity that is triggering this input (i.e. the button that was pushed)
function Entity:Fire(input, param, delay, activator, caller) end

---Called before firing clientside animation events, such as muzzle flashes or shell ejections.
---
--- See [ENTITY:HandleAnimEvent](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:HandleAnimEvent) for the serverside version.
---
--- **NOTE**: This hook only works on "anim", "nextbot" and "ai" type entities.
---@hook FireAnimationEvent
---@realm client
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:FireAnimationEvent
---@param pos Vector Position of the effect
---@param ang Angle Angle of the effect
---@param event number The event ID of happened even. See [this page](http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Animation_Events). Only event IDs above 5000 will appear in this hook. (Are considered the "new" system in-engine)

---@return boolean # Return true to disable the effect
function Entity:FireAnimationEvent(pos, ang, event, name) end

---Fires a bullet.
---
--- When used in a  hook such as [WEAPON:Think](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/WEAPON:Think) or [WEAPON:PrimaryAttack](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/WEAPON:PrimaryAttack), it will use [Player:LagCompensation](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player:LagCompensation) internally.
---
--- Lag compensation will not work if this function is called in a timer, regardless if the timer was made in a predicted hook.
---
--- Due to how `Entity:FireBullets` is set up internally, bullet tracers will always originate from the first attachment/index 1. This can be avoided by supplying your own tracer effect.
---
--- When firing bullets from a [Weapon](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Weapon), it is recommended to fire bullets from the weapon owner entity ([Player](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player) or [NPC](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/NPC)), not the [Weapon](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Weapon) itself.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:FireBullets
---@param bulletInfo Bullet The bullet data to be used. See the Structures/Bullet.
---@param suppressHostEvents? boolean Has the effect of encasing the FireBullets call in Global.SuppressHostEvents, only works in multiplayer.
function Entity:FireBullets(bulletInfo, suppressHostEvents) end

---Makes an entity follow another entity's bone.
---
--- Internally this function calls [Entity:SetParent](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetParent)( parent, boneid ), [Entity:AddEffects](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:AddEffects)( EF_FOLLOWBONE
---  ) and sets an internal flag to always rebuild all bones.
--- **NOTE**: If the entity vibrates or stops following the parent, you probably need to run [Entity:SetPredictable](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetPredictable)( true ) clientside.
---
--- **WARNING**: This function will not work if the target bone's parent bone is invalid or if the bone is not used by VERTEX LOD0
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:FollowBone
---@param parent? Entity The entity to follow the bone of. If unset, removes the FollowBone effect.
---@param boneid number The bone to follow
function Entity:FollowBone(parent, boneid) end

---Forces the entity to be dropped, if it is being held by a player's Gravity Gun, Physics Gun or `+use` pickup.
---
--- See also [Player:DropObject](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player:DropObject).
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:ForcePlayerDrop
function Entity:ForcePlayerDrop() end

---Advances the cycle of an animated entity.
---
--- Animations that loop will automatically reset the cycle so you don't have to - ones that do not will stop animating once you reach the end of their sequence.
---
--- **WARNING**: Do not call this function multiple times a frame, as it can cause unexpected results, such as animations playing at increased rate, etc.
---
--- [NextBot:BodyMoveXY](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/NextBot:BodyMoveXY) calls this internally, so do not call this function before or after [NextBot:BodyMoveXY](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/NextBot:BodyMoveXY).
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:FrameAdvance
function Entity:FrameAdvance() end

---Returns the entity's velocity.
---
--- **NOTE**: Actually binds to CBaseEntity::GetLocalVelocity() which retrieves the velocity of the entity due to its movement in the world from forces such as gravity. Does not include velocity from entity-on-entity collision.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetAbsVelocity
---@return Vector # The velocity of the entity.
function Entity:GetAbsVelocity() end

---Gets the angles of given entity.
---
--- This returns incorrect results for the local player clientside.
---
--- This will return the local player's [Global.EyeAngles](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.EyeAngles) in [rendering hooks](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/3D_Rendering_Hooks).
---
--- This will return [Global.Angle](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.Angle)(0,0,0) in [rendering hooks](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/3D_Rendering_Hooks) while paused in single-player.

---Returns the position and angle of the given attachment, relative to the world.
---
--- **WARNING**: This function can return entity's `GetPos()` instead if the entity doesn't have it's bone cache set up.
---
--- To ensure the bone position is correct use this:
--- ```lua
--- local pos = ent:GetBonePosition(0)
--- if pos == ent:GetPos() then
--- 	pos = ent:GetBoneMatrix(0):GetTranslation()
--- end
--- ```
---
--- **NOTE**: This function returns the bone position from the last tick, so if your framerate is higher than the server's tickrate it may appear to lag behind if used on a fast moving entity. You can fix this by using the bone's matrix instead:
--- ```lua
--- local matrix = entity:GetBoneMatrix(0)
--- local pos = matrix:GetTranslation()
--- local ang = matrix:GetAngles()
--- ```
---
--- This can return the server's position during server lag.
---
--- This can return garbage serverside or [Global.Vector](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.Vector)(0,0,0) for v49 models.
---
--- This can return garbage if a trace passed through the target bone during bone matrix access.

---
--- [Entity:SetParent](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetParent) however also calls [Entity:SetMoveParent](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetMoveParent).
---
--- This means that some entities in the returned list might have a NULL [Entity:GetParent](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetParent).

---Returns the entity's velocity.
---
--- This returns the total velocity of the entity and is equal to local velocity + base velocity.
---
--- Clientside the velocity may be estimated for certain entities, such as physics based entities, instead of returning the "real" velocity from the server.

---Causes the entity to break into its current models gibs, if it has any.
---
--- You must call [Entity:PrecacheGibs](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:PrecacheGibs) on the entity before using this function, or it will not create any gibs.
---
--- If called on server, the gibs will be spawned on the currently connected clients and will not be synchronized. Otherwise the gibs will be spawned only for the client the function is called on.
---
--- **NOTE**: this function will not remove or hide the entity it is called on.

--- **NOTE**: Instead of calling this method directly, it's a good idea to call the global [Global.IsValid](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.IsValid) instead, however if you're sure the variable you're using is always an entity object it's better to use this method
---
--- It will check whether the given variable contains an object (an Entity) or nothing at all for you. See examples.
---
--- **WARNING**: NULL entities can still be assigned with key/value pairs, but they will be instantly negated. See example 3
---
--- This might be a cause for a lot of headache. Usually happening during networking etc., when completely valid entities suddenly become invalid on the client, but are never filtered with IsValid(). See [GM:InitPostEntity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:InitPostEntity) for more details.

---Turns the [Entity:GetPhysicsObject](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetPhysicsObject) into a physics shadow.
--- It's used internally for the Player's and NPC's physics object, and certain HL2 entities such as the crane.
---
--- A physics shadow can be used to have static entities that never move by setting both arguments to false.
---
--- **NOTE**: Unlike [Entity:PhysicsInitShadow](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:PhysicsInitShadow), this function doesn't remove the current physics object.

---Sets custom bone angles.
---
--- When used repeatedly serverside, this method is strongly discouraged due to the huge network traffic produced
---
--- As of update `2024.10.29` this has been resolved. However, network traffic is still generated and should be taken into consideration.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:ManipulateBoneAngles

---Manipulates the bone's jiggle status. This allows non jiggly bones to become jiggly.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:ManipulateBoneJiggle
---@param boneID number Index of the bone you want to manipulate.

---@param networking? boolean boolean to network these changes (if called from server)
function Entity:ManipulateBonePosition(boneID, pos, networking) end

---Sets custom bone scale.
--- This does not scale procedural bones.
--- **NOTE**: This silently fails when given a Vector with nan values, hiding the vertices associated with the bone. See example below.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:ManipulateBoneScale
---@param boneID number Index of the bone you want to manipulate
---@param scale Vector Scale vector to apply. Note that the scale is relative to the original bone scale, not relative to the world or the entity.
function Entity:ManipulateBoneScale(boneID, scale) end

---Returns entity's map creation ID. Unlike [Entity:EntIndex](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:EntIndex) or [Entity:GetCreationID](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetCreationID), it will always be the same on same map, no matter how much you clean up or restart it.
---
--- It may change if the map is recompiled, even if no edits were made. It will definitely change if entities are added or removed from the map file.
---
--- To be used in conjunction with [ents.GetMapCreatedEntity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ents.GetMapCreatedEntity). See also [Entity:CreatedByMap](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:CreatedByMap).

---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:MuzzleFlash
function Entity:MuzzleFlash() end

---Performs a Ray-Orientated Bounding Box intersection from the given position to the origin of the OBBox with the entity and returns the hit position on the OBBox.
---
--- This relies on the entity having a collision mesh (not a physics object) and will be affected by `SOLID_NONE`
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NearestPoint
---@param position Vector The vector to start the intersection from.
---@return Vector # The nearest hit point of the entity's bounding box in world coordinates.
function Entity:NearestPoint(position) end

---Creates a network variable on the entity and adds Set/Get functions for it. This function should only be called in [ENTITY:SetupDataTables](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:SetupDataTables).
---
--- See [Entity:NetworkVarNotify](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVarNotify) for a function to hook NetworkVar changes.
---
--- **NOTE**: Entity NetworkVars are influenced by the return value of [ENTITY:UpdateTransmitState](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:UpdateTransmitState).
--- 	So if you use the **PVS**(**default**), then the NetworkVars can be different for each client.
---
--- **WARNING**: Make sure to not call the SetDT* and your custom set methods on the client realm unless you know exactly what you are doing.
---
--- Combining this function with [util.TableToJSON](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.TableToJSON) can also provide a way to network tables as serialized strings.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVar
---@overload fun(type: string, name: string, extended?: table)
---@param type string Supported choices:
---
--- * `String` (up to 511 characters)
--- * `Bool`
--- * `Float`
--- * `Int` (32-bit signed integer)
--- * `Vector`
--- * `Angle`
--- * `Entity`
---@param slot number Each network variable has to have a unique slot. The slot is per type - so you can have an int in slot `0`, a bool in slot `0` and a float in slot `0` etc. You can't have two ints in slot `0`, instead you would do a int in slot `0` and another int in slot `1`.
---
--- The max slots for strings `4` - so you should pick a number between `0` and `3`.
---
--- The max slots for everything else `32` - so you should pick a number between `0` and `31`.
---
--- This can be omitted entirely (arguments will shift) and it will use the next available slot.
---@param name string The name will affect how you access it. If you call it `Foo` you would add two new functions on your entity - `SetFoo()` and `GetFoo()`. So be careful that what you call it won't collide with any existing functions (don't call it `Pos` for example).
---@param extended? table A table of extended information.
---
--- `KeyName`
--- * Allows the NetworkVar to be set using Entity:SetKeyValue.
--- * This is **required** for the entity editing to work.
---
--- This is useful if you're making an entity that you want to be loaded in a map. The sky entity uses this.
---
--- `Edit`
--- * The edit key lets you mark this variable as editable. See Editable Entities for more information.
function Entity:NetworkVar(type, slot, name, extended) end

---Similarly to [Entity:NetworkVar](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVar), creates a network variable on the entity and adds Set/Get functions for it. This method stores it's value as a member value of a vector or an angle. This allows to go beyond the normal variable limit of [Entity:NetworkVar](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVar) for `Int` and `Float` types, at the expense of `Vector` and `Angle` limit.
---
--- This function should only be called in [ENTITY:SetupDataTables](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:SetupDataTables).
---
--- **WARNING**: Make sure to not call the SetDT* and your custom set methods on the client realm unless you know exactly what you are doing.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVarElement
---@overload fun(type: string, element: string, name: string, extended?: table)
---@param type string Supported choices:
--- * `Vector`
--- * `Angle`
---@param slot number The slot for this `Vector` or `Angle`, from `0` to `31`. See Entity:NetworkVar for more detailed explanation.
---
--- This can be omitted entirely (arguments will shift) and it will use the next available slot.
---@param element string Which element of a `Vector` or an `Angle` to store the value on. This can be `p`, `y`, `r` for Angles, and `x`, `y`, `z` for Vectors
---@param name string The name will affect how you access it. If you call it `Foo` you would add two new functions on your entity - `SetFoo()` and `GetFoo()`. So be careful that what you call it won't collide with any existing functions (don't call it "Pos" for example).
---@param extended? table A table of extra information. See Entity:NetworkVar for details.
function Entity:NetworkVarElement(type, slot, element, name, extended) end

---Creates a callback that will execute when the given network variable changes - that is, when the `Set()` function is run.
---
--- The callback is executed **before** the value is changed, and is called even if the new and old values are the same.
---
--- This function does not exist on entities in which [Entity:InstallDataTable](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:InstallDataTable) has not been called.
---
--- By default, this means this function only exists on SENTs (both serverside and clientside) and on players with a [Player Class](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player_Classes) (serverside and clientside [Global.LocalPlayer](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.LocalPlayer) only).
---
--- It's therefore safest to only use this in [ENTITY:SetupDataTables](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:SetupDataTables).
---
--- The callback will not be called clientside if the var is changed right after entity spawn.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:NetworkVarNotify
---@param name string Name of variable to track changes of.
---@param callback fun(entity: Entity, name: string, old: any, new: any) The function to call when the variable changes.
---
--- Function argument(s):
--- * Entity `entity` - Entity whos variable changed.
--- * string `name` - Name of changed variable.
--- * any `old` - Old/current variable value.
--- * any `new` - New variable value that it was set to.

---Controls when, relative to [Global.CurTime](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.CurTime), the [Entity](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity) will next run its Think function.
---
--- For Scripted Entities, this is the [ENTITY:Think](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:Think) function.
--- For engine Entities, this is an internal function whose behavior will depend on the specific Entity type.
---
--- For a Client-side equivalent, see [Entity:SetNextClientThink](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetNextClientThink).

---Returns the entity's capabilities as a bitfield.
---
--- In the engine this function is mostly used to check the use type, the save/restore system and level transitions flags.
---
--- Even though the function is defined shared, it is not guaranteed to return the same value across states.
---

---Initializes the physics mesh of the entity with a convex mesh defined by a table of points. The resulting mesh is the  of all the input points. If successful, the previous physics object will be removed.
---
--- This is the standard way of creating moving physics objects with a custom convex shape. For more complex, concave shapes, see [Entity:PhysicsInitMultiConvex](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:PhysicsInitMultiConvex).
---

---
--- **NOTE**: Players are lag compensated by default and there's no need to call this function for them.
---
--- It's best to not enable lag compensation on parented entities, as the system does not handle it that well ( they will be moved back but then the entity will lag behind ).
--- Parented entities move back with the parent if it's lag compensated, so if you are making some kind of armor piece you shouldn't do anything.
---
--- As a side note for parented entities, if your entity can be shot at, keep in mind that its collision bounds need to be bigger than the bone's hitbox the entity is parented to, or hull/line traces ( such as the crowbar attack or bullets ) might not hit at all.

---Sets the rendering material override of the entity.
---
--- To set a Lua material created with [Global.CreateMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.CreateMaterial), just prepend a "!" to the material name.
---
--- If you wish to override a single material on the model, use [Entity:SetSubMaterial](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetSubMaterial) instead.
---
--- **NOTE**: To apply materials to models, that material **must** have **VertexLitGeneric** shader. For that reason you cannot apply map textures onto models, map textures use a different material shader - **LightmappedGeneric**, which can be used on brush entities.
---
--- The server's value takes priority on the client.

---Uniformly scales the model of the entity, if the entity is a [Player](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Player) or an [NPC](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/NPC) the hitboxes will be scaled as well.
---
--- To resize the entity non-uniformly, along any axis, use [Entity:EnableMatrix](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:EnableMatrix) instead.
---
--- For some entities (Such as `prop_physics` and `anim` type [Scripted Entities](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Scripted_Entities)), calling [Entity:Activate](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:Activate) after this will scale the collision bounds and [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj) as well; be wary as there's no optimization being done internally and highly complex collision models might crash the server.
---
--- Client-side trace detection seems to mess up if `deltaTime` is set to anything but zero. A very small decimal can be used instead of zero to solve this issue.
---
--- If your old scales are wrong, use [Entity:SetLegacyTransform](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetLegacyTransform) as a quick fix.
---
--- **NOTE**: If you do not want the physics to be affected by [Entity:Activate](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:Activate), you can use [Entity:ManipulateBoneScale](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:ManipulateBoneScale)`( 0, Vector( scale, scale, scale ) )` instead.
---
---  On the client, `anim` types' collision testing prediction fails for changed model scales: you can use `cl_showerror 2` to see by how much. Essentially, the client will freak out when you stand/run past on a Scripted Entity or prop that has been modified using this method.
---
--- This disables IK.

---Sets the owner of this entity, disabling all physics interaction with it.
---
--- **NOTE**: This function is generally used to disable physics interactions on projectiles being fired by their owner, but can also be used for normal ownership in case physics interactions are not involved at all. The Gravity gun will be able to pick up the entity even if the owner can't collide with it, the Physics gun however will not.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetOwner
---@param owner? Entity The entity to be set as owner.
function Entity:SetOwner(owner) end

---Sets the parent of this entity, making it move with its parent. This will make the child entity non solid, nothing can interact with them, including traces (but [util.TraceHull](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/util.TraceHull) will work).
---
--- All children of the parent get removed whenever it gets removed.
---
--- **NOTE**: This does not work on [the world](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/game.GetWorld).
---
--- **WARNING**: This can cause undefined physics behavior when used on entities that don't support parenting. See the [Valve developer wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Entity_Hierarchy_(parenting)) for more information.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetParent
---@param parent? Entity The entity to parent to. Setting this to nil will clear the parent.
---@param attachmentOrBoneId? number The attachment or bone id to use when parenting. Defaults to -1 or whatever the parent had set previously.
---
--- Use Entity:AddEffects( EF_FOLLOWBONE ) to treat this argument as a Bone ID instead of an Attachment ID. Similar to Entity:FollowBone.
---
--- You must call [Entity:SetMoveType](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetMoveType)( MOVETYPE_NONE ) on the child for this argument to have any effect!
--- Parenting to attachment IDs more than `255` is unsupported and will output a LUA error.
function Entity:SetParent(parent, attachmentOrBoneId) end

---Sets the parent of an entity to another entity with the given physics bone number. Similar to [Entity:SetParent](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetParent), except it is parented to a physbone. This function is useful mainly for ragdolls.
---
--- **NOTE**: Despite this function being available server side, it doesn't actually do anything server side.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetParentPhysNum
---@param bone number Physics bone number to attach to. Use 0 for objects with only one physics bone. (See Entity:GetPhysicsObjectNum)
function Entity:SetParentPhysNum(bone) end

---Sets whether or not the given entity is persistent. A persistent entity will be saved on server shutdown and loaded back when the server starts up. Additionally, by default persistent entities cannot be grabbed with the physgun and tools cannot be used on them.
---
--- In sandbox, this can be set on an entity by opening the context menu, right clicking the entity, and choosing `"Make Persistent"`.
---
--- **NOTE**: Persistence can only be enabled with the sbox_persist convar, which works as an identifier for the current set of persistent entities. An empty identifier (which is the default value) disables this feature.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetPersistent
---@param persist boolean Whether or not the entity should be persistent.
function Entity:SetPersistent(persist) end

---When called on a constraint entity, sets the two physics objects to be constrained.
---
--- Usage is not recommended as the Constraint library provides easier ways to deal with constraints.
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetPhysConstraintObjects
---@param Phys1 PhysObj The first physics object to be constrained.
---@param Phys2 PhysObj The second physics object to be constrained.
function Entity:SetPhysConstraintObjects(Phys1, Phys2) end

---Sets the player who gets credit if this entity kills something with physics damage within the time limit.
---
--- **NOTE**: Only functional on props, "anim" type SENTs, vehicles and a few other select entities.
---@realm server
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetPhysicsAttacker
---@param ent Player Player who gets the kills. Setting this to a non-player entity will not work.
---@param timeLimit? number Time in seconds until the entity forgets its physics attacker and prevents it from getting the kill credit.
function Entity:SetPhysicsAttacker(ent, timeLimit) end

---Allows you to set how fast an entity's animation will play, with 1.0 being the default speed.
---
--- It is networked to clients, but limited to [-4,12] range when networking.
---
--- **NOTE**: This function does not affect gestures.
--- 	Use [Entity:SetLayerPlaybackRate](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetLayerPlaybackRate) instead.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetPlaybackRate
---@param fSpeed number How fast the animation will play.
function Entity:SetPlaybackRate(fSpeed) end

---Moves the entity to the specified position.
---
--- Some entities, such as ragdolls, will continually reset their position. Consider using [PhysObj:SetPos](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj:SetPos) on every physics object to move ragdolls.
---
--- **NOTE**: If the new position doesn't take effect right away, you can use [Entity:SetupBones](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetupBones) to force it to do so. This issue is especially common when trying to render the same entity twice or more in a single frame at different positions.
---
--- **WARNING**: Entities with [Entity:GetSolid](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:GetSolid) of `SOLID_BBOX` will have their angles reset!
---
--- This will fail inside of predicted functions called during player movement processing. This includes [WEAPON:PrimaryAttack](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/WEAPON:PrimaryAttack) and [WEAPON:Think](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/WEAPON:Think).
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetPos
---@param position Vector The position to move the entity to.
function Entity:SetPos(position) end

---Sets the specified pose parameter to the specified value.
---
--- You should call [Entity:InvalidateBoneCache](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:InvalidateBoneCache) after calling this function.
---
--- **NOTE**: Avoid calling this in draw hooks, especially when animating things, as it might cause visual artifacts.
---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetPoseParameter
---@param poseName string|number Name of the pose parameter. Entity:GetPoseParameterName might come in handy here.
---
--- Can also be a pose parameter ID.
---@param poseValue number The value to set the pose to.
function Entity:SetPoseParameter(poseName, poseValue) end

---Sets whether an entity should be predictable or not.
--- When an entity is set as predictable, its DT vars can be changed during predicted hooks. This is useful for entities which can be controlled by player input.
---
--- Any datatable value that mismatches from the server will be overridden and a prediction error will be spewed.
---
--- Weapons are predictable by default, and the drive system uses this function to make the controlled prop predictable as well.
---
--- Visit  for a list of all predicted hooks, and the [Prediction](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Prediction) page.
--- For further technical information on the subject, visit [valve's wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Prediction).
---
--- **NOTE**: This function resets the datatable variables everytime it's called, it should ideally be called when a player starts using the entity and when he stops
---
--- **NOTE**: Entities set as predictable with this function will be unmarked when the user lags and receives a full packet update, to handle such case visit [GM:NotifyShouldTransmit](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/GM:NotifyShouldTransmit)
---@realm client
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetPredictable

---Sets the entity's model sequence.
---
--- If the specified sequence is already active, the animation will not be restarted. See [Entity:ResetSequence](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:ResetSequence) for a function that restarts the animation even if it is already playing.
---
--- In some cases you want to run [Entity:ResetSequenceInfo](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:ResetSequenceInfo) to make this function run.
---
--- **NOTE**: This will not work properly if called directly after calling [Entity:SetModel](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:SetModel). Consider waiting until the next Tick.

---@param freezable? boolean True to make the entity unfreezable, false otherwise.
function Entity:SetUnFreezable(freezable) end

---Forces the entity to reconfigure its bones. You might need to call this after changing your model's scales or when manually drawing the entity multiple times at different positions.
---
--- **NOTE**: This calls the BuildBonePositions callback added via [Entity:AddCallback](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:AddCallback), so avoid calling this function inside it to prevent an infinite loop.

---Initializes the class names of an entity's phoneme mappings (mouth movement data). This is called by default with argument "phonemes" when a flex-based entity (such as an [NPC](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/NPC)) is created.
---
--- **NOTE**: TF2 phonemes can be accessed by using a path such as "player/scout/phonemes/phonemes" , check TF2's "tf2_misc_dir.vpk" with GCFScape for other paths, however it seems that TF2 sounds don't contain phoneme definitions anymore after being converted to mp3 and only rely on VCD animations, this needs to be further investigated

---
--- **NOTE**: Actually binds to CBaseEntity::SetBaseVelocity() which sets the entity's velocity due to forces applied by other entities.
---
--- **WARNING**: If applied to a player, this will actually **ADD** velocity, not set it. (due to how movement code handles base velocity)

---@realm shared
---@source https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:Spawn
function Entity:Spawn() end

---This is the spawn function. It's called when a player spawns the entity from the spawnmenu.
---
--- If you want to make your SENT spawnable you need this function to properly create the entity.
---
--- **WARNING**: Unlike other ENTITY functions, the "self" parameter of this function is not an entity but rather the table used to generate the SENT. This table is equivalent to [scripted_ents.GetStored](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/scripted_ents.GetStored)("ent_name").

---Starts a "looping" sound. As with any other sound playing methods, this function expects the sound file to be looping itself and will not automatically loop a non looping sound file as one might expect.
---
--- This function is almost identical to [Global.CreateSound](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global.CreateSound), with the exception of the sound being created in the STATIC channel and with normal attenuation.

---Starts a motion controller in the physics engine tied to this entity's [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj), which enables the use of [ENTITY:PhysicsSimulate](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/ENTITY:PhysicsSimulate).
---
--- The motion controller can later be destroyed via [Entity:StopMotionController](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:StopMotionController).
---
--- Motion controllers are used internally to control other Entities' [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj)ects, such as the Gravity Gun, +use pickup and the Physics Gun.
---
--- This function should be called every time you recreate the Entity's [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj). Or alternatively you should call [Entity:AddToMotionController](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Entity:AddToMotionController) on the new [PhysObj](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/PhysObj).
