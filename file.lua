--- The file library provides functions for finding, reading and writing to files.
--- The following path values are most commonly used:
--- * `LUA` searches the lua files (in /lua/, in your gamemodes, in all the addons).
--- * `GAME` searches all the mounted content (main folder, addons, mounted games etc).
--- * `MOD` searches only the garrysmod folder.
--- * `DATA` searches in the data folder.
---
--- See [File Search Paths](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/File_Search_Paths) for the descriptive list of path values.
--- For the full list of path values, type `path` in the console.
file = {}

---Appends data to a file in the `data/` folder.
---@realm shared
---@realm menu

---@param fileName string The name of the file.

---@param callback fun(fileName: string, gamePath: string, status: number, data: string) A callback function that will be called when the file read operation finishes.
---
--- Function argument(s):
--- * string `fileName` - The `fileName` argument above.
--- * string `gamePath` - The `gamePath` argument above.
--- * number `status` - The status of the operation. The list can be found in Enums/FSASYNC.
